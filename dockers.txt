Dockers:
docker version - check client/server version and make sure server is running

old way: docker <command>(options) 
new way: docker <command><sub-command>(options)


docker container run --detach --publish 80:80 --name nginx nginx
docker container ls (the new way for "docker ps" - show running containers)
docker container ls -a (shows all container )
docker container logs <name> - shows what would have written on screen in case we didn't run in the background
docker container top <name> - show inner top
docker container rm <name> - remove container

docker image ls - list images
docker container stats - live performance stats for all containers
docker container inspect - details of one container config
docker container run -it (start container in interactive mode)
docker container exec -it <program_name> (run additional commands in existing container , usually we run bash in program_name)

dockert tag <old name> <new name> - create a new name for an existing image (if you want to push it you should add your username/ before the name)

docker volume ls - gives the ids of all the volumes
docker volume inspect <id> - actually see the actual location of the volume on the host (mountpoint)
note that stopping or removing containers doesn't remove the volume
when creating a container you can pass '-v name:/some/path' to give a friendly name to the volume (to see it nice with docker volume ls command), note that it works only if docker was created with a VOLUME in the Dockerfile

-v /some.path:/some/path -creates a bind mount (no need VOLUME for this)

Dockerfile:
Use COPY not ADD unless you must

RUN npm install && cache clean --force

use node not npm
 - npm requires another application to run, npm lunches node as a subproccess
 - doesn't work well as an init or PID 1 process (problems with signals)


Use WORKDIR not mkdir - unless you need chown

Official node images have a node user
	- use it after apt/apk and npm i -g
	- do thi before npm i
	- may require chown node:node
	COMMANDS:
		- USER node
		- RUN mkdir app && chwon -R node:node .
		- COPY --chown node:node . .
		- RUN,CMD,ENTRYPOINT will run as node if writen afer USER node





Networking:

docker container port <name> - show port forwrding for container

docket network ls - list all availible netwoeks
docker network create <name> - spawn a new virtual network to attach containers to
docker container run ... --network <network_name> - start container attached to newtork_name
docker network connect/disconnect.. - use to connect or disconnect networks to a running docker
